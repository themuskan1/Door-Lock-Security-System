# Door-Lock-Security-System
In todayâ€™s world, majority of the people are concerned regarding the security of their personal and important belongings. The security of homes, banks, and organizations, etc. which contains valuable documents, ornaments and money is now a major issue due to increasing theft and less secure systems. Henceforth, keeping and increasing the level of security is the need of the hour. The project that is now been described is a triple secured system which is an advanced, easy, low cost and alert security system. It ensures that the identification of the user is biometric as well as digital. In this triple identification system, the three layers of security are Radio Frequency Identification i.e., the RFID module (MRFC522), Numeric Keypad i.e., the 4*4 Keypad (alphanumeric) and Optical Fingerprint Reader i.e., the Fingerprint Sensor (R305) in the same order. The microcontroller used for controlling the opening and closing of the door and management of the three layers is Arduino Mega (2560). The Servo Motor (SG90), ensures the closing and opening of the door after successful identification of the user. The user needs to be sure of the correctness of each and every stage because the Buzzer is used as an alert to aware the surrounding regarding the wrong identity of the user at any stage of identification.
